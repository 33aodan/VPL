## Instructions
1. download your Striker bot's pdf
2. Move the PDF to the directory that includes the PDFInterpreter.py and PDFI2.py
3. in PDFInterpreter.py change the PDF_path to what your PDF name is (changing the original PDF name makes it a lot easier)
4. make a new .txt file named "list" inside of the directory
5. run PDFInterpreter.py
6. go through list.txt, reformat any part number code that isn't formatted in either "XXX-XXXX-XXX" or "XXX-XXXX", X being number placeholders
7. run PDFI2.py, copy and past your data to a google doc and retrieve your parts!

## INFO
**This might be inaccurate. If you have to check your parts out, I reccommend that you ask your club's sponsor if you can return unused parts.**
